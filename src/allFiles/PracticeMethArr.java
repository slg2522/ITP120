		/**In physics, an object that is in motion is said to have
		 * kinetic energy. The following formula can be used to
		 * determine a moving object's kinetic energy:
		 * KE = 1/2 mv^2
		 * where KE = kinetic energy
		 * m = object mass (kilograms)
		 * v = velocity (m/s)
		 * 
		 * Write a method named kineticEnergy that accepts an
		 * object's mass (in kilograms) and velocity (in meters
		 * per second) as arguments. The method should return the
		 * amount of kinetic energy that the object has.
		 * Demonstrate the method by calling it in a program that
		 * asks the user to enter values for mass and velocity.*/

	/**Write a program that tests your ESP (extrasensory perception).
	 * The program should randomly select the name of a color from the
	 * following list of words:
	 *      Red, Green, Blue, Orange, Yellow
	 * To select a word, the program can generate a random number. For
	 * example, if the number is 0, the selected word is Red; if the
	 * number is 1, the selected word is Green; and so forth.
	 * 
	 *  Next, the program should ask the user to enter the color that
	 *  the computer has selected. After the user has entered the guess,
	 *  the program should display the name of the randomly selected color.
	 *  The program should repeat this 10 times and then display the
	 *  number of times the user correctly guessed the selected color.
	 *  Be sure to modularize the program into methods that perform each task.*/

	/**Write a RainFall class that stores the total rainfall for each of 12 months
	 * into an array of doubles. The program should have methods that return the
	 * following:
	 * 		-the total rainfall for the year
	 * 		-the average monthly rainfall
	 * 		-the month with the most rain
	 * 		-the month with the least rain
	 * Demonstrate the class in a complete program.
	 * Input Validation: Do not accept negative numbers for monthly rainfall figures.*/

	 * Assume that the array contains integers. The method should display all of the

	/**The profit from the sale of a stock can be calculated as follows:
	 * 			Profit=((NS * SP)-SC) - ((NS * PP) + PC)
	 * where NS is the number of shares, PP is the purchase price per share, PC is the
	 * purchare commission paid, SP is the sale price per share, and SC is the sale
	 * commission paid. If the calculation yields a positive value, then the
	 * sale of the stock resulted in a profit. If the calculation yields a negative
	 * number, then the sale resulted in a loss.
	 * 
	 * Write a method that accepts, as arguments, the number of shares, the purchase price
	 * per share, the purchase commission paid, the sale per share, the sale commission
	 * paid. The method should return the profit (or loss) from the sale of the stock.
	 * Demonstrate the method in a program that asks the user to enter the necessary data
	 * and displays the amount of the profit or loss.*/
